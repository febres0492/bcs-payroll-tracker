# Changes:
### I added the logic for three functions:

### collectEmployees:
* In this function I just had to add le logic to collect the name, lastname and the salary of employees usign a while loop, window.promt and window.confirm


### displayAverageSalary:
*  in this function I just had to add the logic to calculate the average salary of all the employees and log it to the console.


### getRandomEmployee:
*  In this function I just had to add the logic to pick a random index from the employees array and log the employee at that index to the console
